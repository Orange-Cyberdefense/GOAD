## Description
GOAD is a pentest active directory LAB project.
The purpose of this lab is to give pentesters a vulnerable Active directory environment ready to use to practice usual attack techniques.

> **Warning**
> This lab is extremely vulnerable, do not reuse recipe to build your environment and do not deploy this environment on internet without isolation (this is a recommendation, use it as your own risk).<br>
> This repository was build for pentest practice.

## Licenses
This lab use free windows VM only (180 days). After that delay enter a license on each server or rebuild all the lab (may be it's time for an update ;))

## Available labs

- [GOAD](./ad/GOAD/README.md) : 5 vms, 2 forests, 3 domains (full goad lab)

- [MINILAB](./ad/MINILAB/README.md): 2 vms, 1 forst, 1 domain (basic lab with one DC (windows server 2019) and one Workstation (windows 10))

- [SCCM](./ad/SCCM/README.md) : 4 vms, 1 forest, 1 domain, with microsoft configuration manager installed

- [NHA](./ad/NHA/README.md) : A challenge with 5 vms and 2 domains. no schema provided, you will have to find out how break it.

## Requirements

- Used space
  - The lab takes about 77GB (but you have to get the space for the vms vagrant images windows server 2016 (22GB) / windows server 2019 (14GB) / ubuntu 18.04 (502M))
  - The total space needed for the lab is ~115 GB (and more if you take snapshots)

- Linux operating system
  - The lab intend to be installed from a **Linux host** and was tested only on this.
  - Some people have successfully installed the lab from a windows OS, to do that they create the VMs with vagrant and have done the ansible provisioning part from a linux machine.
  - In this case the linux machine used to do the provisioning must be setup with one adapter on NAT and one adapter on the same virtual private network as the lab.


### tldr; quick install

- You are on linux, you already got virtualbox, vagrant and docker installed on your host and you know what you are doing, just run :
```bash
./goad.sh -t check -l GOAD -p virtualbox -m docker
./goad.sh -t install -l GOAD -p virtualbox  -m docker
```
- Now you can grab a coffee :coffee: it will take time :)

## Installation

- Installation depend of the provider you use, please follow the appropriate guide :
  - [Install with Virtualbox](./docs/install_with_virtualbox.md)
  - [Install with VmWare](./docs/install_with_vmware.md)
  - [Install with Proxmox](./docs/install_with_proxmox.md)
  - [Install with Azure](./docs/install_with_azure.md)

- Installation is in three parts :
  1. Templating : this will create the template to use (needed only for proxmox) 
  2. Providing : this will instantiate the virtual machines depending on your provider
  3. Provisioning : it is always made with ansible, it will install all the stuff to create the lab

### Check before install

- For linux users check dependencies installation before install :

```
./goad -t check -l <LAB> -p <PROVIDER> -m <ANSIBLE_RUN_METHOD>
```

- LAB: lab must be one of the following (folder in ad/)
   - GOAD
   - GOAD-Light

- PROVIDER : provider must be one of the following:
   - virtualbox
   - vmware
   - azure
   - proxmox

- ANSIBLE_RUN_METHOD : ansible method to use :
   - local : to use local ansible install
   - docker : to use docker ansible install

- **Please install all the needed tools before run the install process**
- There is no automatic installer for the dependencies tools (virtualbox, vagrant, python, ansible,... ) you will have to install them by yourself depending on your package manager an linux system.

### Install

- Launch all the install (vagrant or terraform) vms creation followed by ansible provisioning :

```
./goad -t install -l <LAB> -p <PROVIDER> -m <ANSIBLE_RUN_METHOD>
```

- The goad install will run all the ansible playbook one by one with a failover to restart the ansible playbook if something goes wrong (sometimes vms or playbook hit timeout so this will restart the playbook automatically)

### goad.sh options

- `-a` : ansible only is played during install task (no vagrant or terraform). This is useful if you install and run vagrant on windows and then launch the provisioning from a different computer (example : a kali linux connected to goad network)
- `-r <ansible_file.yml>` : run only one ansible task (useful to run elk.yml or run only one playbook)
- `-e` : enable elk in vagrant (example to install elk and play the elk playbook once you finish goad install run : `./goad.sh -t install -l GOAD -p virtualbox -m local -e elk -r elk.yml`)

## Provisioning

- The provisioning is always done with ansible, more detail on the ansible provisioning here : [Ansible provisioning](./docs/provisioning.md)

## Lab organization

- The lab configuration is located on the ad/ folder
- Each Ad folder correspond to a lab and contains the following files :

```
ad/
  labname/            # The lab name must be the same as the variable : domain_name from the data/inventory
    data/
      config.json     #Â The json file containing all the variables and configuration of the lab
      inventory       # The global lab inventory (provider independent) (this should no contains variables)
    files/            # This folder contains files you want to copy on your vms
    scripts/          # This folder contains ps1 scripts you want to play on your vm (Must be added in the "scripts" entries of your vms)
    providers/        # Your lab available provider
      vmware/
        inventory     # specific vmware inventory
        Vagrantfile   # specific vmware vagrantfile
      virtualbox/
        inventory     # specific virtualbox inventory
        Vagrantfile   # specific virtualbox vagrantfile
      proxmox/
        terraform/    # specific proxmox terraform recipe
        inventory     # specific proxmox inventory
      azure/
        terraform/    # specific azure terraform recipe
        inventory     # specific azure inventory
```
