Subject: Quick Departure

Hey Arya,

I hope this message finds you well. Something urgent has come up, and I have to leave for a while. Don't worry; I'll be back soon.

I left a little surprise for you in your room – the sword You've named "Needle." It felt fitting, given your skills. Take care of it, and it'll take care of you.

I'll explain everything when I return. Until then, stay sharp, sis.

Best,
John
