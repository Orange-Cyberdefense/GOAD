# Usage

- Goad script can be run in two ways.
    - [argument_mode](goad_args.md) : launch goad.sh with arguments to launch one task
    - [interactive_mode](goad_console.md) : launch an interactive console to manage multiple labs and instances.

- The easy way to use goad is just launch `./goad.sh` and use `?` in the interactive console to get some help.
