            - Click the Create access key button
            - Create a group "[goad]" in credentials file ~/.aws/credentials

=== ":simple-proxmox: Proxmox"

    For detailed Proxmox installation and setup instructions, please refer to the [Proxmox Provider Documentation](../providers/proxmox.md).

=== "🏟️  Ludus"

    - To add GOAD on Ludus please use goad directly on the server.
    - By now goad can work only directly on the server and not from a workstation client.

    - Install Ludus : [https://docs.ludus.cloud/docs/quick-start/install-ludus/](https://docs.ludus.cloud/docs/quick-start/install-ludus/)

    - Be sure to create an administrator user and keep his api key

    - Once your installation is complete on ludus server (debian 12) and your user is created do :
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/GOAD.git
    cd GOAD
    sudo apt install python3.11-venv
    ./goad.sh
    ...>exit
    vim ~/.goad/goad.ini # add the api_key in the config file (keep impersonate to yes and use an admin user)
    ./goad.sh -p ludus
    ...>set_lab XXX # GOAD/GOAD-Light/NHA/SCCM
    ...>install
    ```

## Prepare your python environment for goad.py

=== "Classic"
    
    - To run the Goad installation/management script you will need : **Python version >=3.8** with venv module installed
    
    - Install the python3-venv corresponding to your python version 
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install python<version>-venv
    ```
    
    - Example:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install python3.10-venv
    ```

    - Then you are ready to launch 

    ```
    ./goad.sh
    ```

    - The script will :
        - verify python version >=3.8
        - create a venv in `~/.goad/.venv`
        - launch python requirements installation
        - launch ansible-galaxy collections requirements installation
        - start goad.py with the venv created

    !!! tip
        if you got an error during requirements installation, look at the error and delete `~/.goad/.venv` before try again

    !!! tip
        if you need to force a python version change the variable `py=python3` to `py=python3.10` for example in the `goad.sh` script

=== "With poetry"

    - Install python dependencies:
    ```
    poetry install
    ``` 

    - Install ansible-galaxy requirements:
        - If python < 3.11
        ```
        poetry run ansible-galaxy ansible/requirements.yml
        ```

        - If python >= 3.11
        ```
        poetry run ansible-galaxy ansible/requirements_311.yml
        ```

    - Run goad:
    ```
    poetry run python3 goad.py
    ```

=== "Provisioning with docker"
    
    !!! info
        With this method ansible-core will not be installed locally on your venv
    
    - [x] be sure you have docker installed on your os for the provisioning part (ansible will be run from the container)
    - [x] To run the Goad installation/management script you will need :
        -  Python (version >= 3.8) with venv module installed
    
    - Install the python3-venv corresponding to your python version 
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install python<version>-venv
    ```
    
    - Example:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install python3.10-venv
    ```
    
    - Run goad with `./goad_docker.sh` instead of `./goad.sh` to install the dependencies without the ansible part (local and runner provisioning method will not be available)
